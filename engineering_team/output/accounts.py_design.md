## Design Overview

This module provides a class `Accounts` that manages user accounts for a trading simulation platform. The class provides functionality for creating accounts, managing deposits and withdrawals, recording share transactions, and calculating portfolio values and profits or losses. The module ensures that users cannot withdraw more funds than they have, buy more shares than they can afford, or sell shares that they do not own.

### Classes and Methods

#### Class: `Account`

- **Attributes**
  - `user_id`: The unique identifier for the user.
  - `balance`: A float representing the current cash balance of the userâ€™s account.
  - `initial_deposit`: A float recording the initial amount deposited when the account was created.
  - `holdings`: A dictionary to store the quantity of shares owned per stock symbol.
  - `transactions`: A list to store records of all transactions including deposits, withdrawals, buys, and sells.

- **Methods**

  ```python
  def __init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float):
      """
      Initializes a new account with a given user_id and an initial deposit.
      Raises ValueError if initial deposit is negative.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
      """
      Deposits a specified amount to the account balance.
      Raises ValueError if amount is negative.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool:
      """
      Withdraws a specified amount from the account balance if sufficient funds exist.
      Raises an error if amount is negative or if funds are insufficient.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
      """
      Buys a specified quantity of shares of a given stock symbol.
      Deducts from balance based on share price provided by get_share_price.
      Raises error if funds are insufficient or quantity is not positive.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool:
      """
      Sells a specified quantity of shares of a given stock symbol.
      Increases balance based on share price and quantity.
      Raises error if selling more shares than owned or if quantity is not positive.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def get_portfolio_value(self) -> float:
      """
      Calculates and returns the total current value of the user's portfolio.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def get_profit_or_loss(self) -> float:
      """
      Calculates and returns the profit or loss from the initial deposit.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def get_holdings(self) -> dict:
      """
      Returns a copy of the current holdings of the user.
      """
  ```

  ```python
  def get_transactions(self) -> list:
      """
      Returns a list of all transactions executed by the user.
      """
  ```

### External Function

- **Function: `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`**
  - A standalone function to return the current price of a given stock symbol.
  - Test implementation returns fixed prices for symbols such as AAPL, TSLA, and GOOGL.

### Error Handling

Ensure appropriate exceptions are handled and raised with descriptive messages for invalid operations like negative deposits, insufficient funds, or invalid share transactions.

### Example Usage

```python
account = Account(user_id="user123", initial_deposit=1000.0)
account.deposit(500.0)
account.withdraw(200.0)
account.buy_shares("AAPL", 10)
portfolio_value = account.get_portfolio_value()
profit_or_loss = account.get_profit_or_loss()
holdings = account.get_holdings()
transactions = account.get_transactions()
```

This detailed design provides a comprehensive structure for implementing the `Accounts` module, ensuring all required operations for account management, transactions, and reporting are covered effectively.
